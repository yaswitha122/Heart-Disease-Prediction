# Heart-Disease-Prediction

****Overview****

This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient attributes. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a heart disease dataset (heart.csv) with 303 records and 13 features. The app allows users to input patient details (e.g., age, sex, cholesterol) and receive a prediction of heart disease risk along with the probability.

The project includes data exploration (via a Jupyter Notebook) and a deployable Streamlit app, demonstrating machine learning in healthcare.
